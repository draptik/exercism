# Clojure

## REPL

The REPL can be started using `clojure` or `lein`.

Leiningen seems to be a bit smarter (f.ex. when using arrow keys).

## IDE

### IDEA community edition with Cursive plugin

Free, nice test integration. Since Clojure runs on the JVM, IntelliJ IDE seems like a good match.

### VS Code

Good allround editor with Clojure support.

### Other

Emacs and Vim probably also have good support...
